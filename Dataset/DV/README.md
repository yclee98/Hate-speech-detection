count = number of CrowdFlower users who coded each tweet (min is 3, sometimes more users coded a tweet when judgments were determined to be unreliable by CF).

hate_speech = number of CF users who judged the tweet to be hate speech.

offensive_language = number of CF users who judged the tweet to be offensive.

neither = number of CF users who judged the tweet to be neither offensive nor non-offensive.

class = class label for majority of CF users. 0 - hate speech 1 - offensive language 2 - neither
